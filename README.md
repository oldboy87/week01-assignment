Week 01 Assignment

01. Setup and test for git

<div> class name "sign" should have probably be named "question" as the corresponding <div> is "answer".

Not to self: Do NOT put "." in a class name!!! Nor "-" or "_". I definitely need to revise which characters are acceptable!

Row-reverse on header causes to company name to push title and nav outside window bounds. Maybe there is something else I can re-order or it's simply down to how I have company name first in order. I think I would need to have them set to in-line instead of space-between (add a gap or something to compensate), ensure nav/title element comes first.

Had much more I wanted to put in here but as the deadline loomed my visits to this readme became non-existant. Lots of needless classes and IDs. Code is a mess. Spent far too much time faffing around with javascript stuff that isn't even a requirement for this assignment, just because I had an idea I loved and couldn't let go of. Couldn't wrap my head around much of it and by the time I went back to html and css my brain was fried. Disaster.
