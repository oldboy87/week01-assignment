Week 01 Assignment

Log:
~~~~~~

I had tried to make this project too complicated by implementing javascript. I have stripped it back just to cover the requirements of the assignment.

Row-reverse on header causes to company name to push title and nav outside window bounds. Maybe there is something else I can re-order or it's simply down to how I have company name first in order. I think I would need to have them set to in-line instead of space-between (add a gap or something to compensate), ensure nav/title element comes first. -EDIT: This was not the case, space-between seemed to cause this, whereas space-around does not have this issue. Looks better, too!

Height size of 1000px for sections was for the purpose of their being more background images, which I didn't have time to implement. This is also why the gradient colour set up has been chosen, to simulate entering earth's atmosphere down to the ground level.
